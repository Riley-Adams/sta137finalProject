# Analysis of Annual Temperature Anomalies
In this project, which was a final project for a course at UC Davis called STA 137: Applied Time Series Analysis, we used R to analyze a data set on annual temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere from 1850 - 2019. In doing so, we:

* Used graphical techniques to understand the nature of the variation in the data.
* Utilized the ACF and PACF plots to make preliminary identification of a time series model.
* Utilized AIC model selection criteria to fit an appropriate ARIMA model.
* Performed graphical diagnostics to determine whether the chosen ARIMA model was appropriate.
* Analyzed a plot of the spectral density and smoothed periodogram for the ARIMA fitted values.
* Assessed the models ability to forcast temperature anomalies.
